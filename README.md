# metal-gameframework

This is a game framework based on the Metal framework on macOS.

Many C++ classes (Quaternion, Matrix4x4, Vector2/3/4, Mathf, etc.) are based on the Unity APIs but they sometimes have some additional methods.

I'm trying to make it able to handle just 2D drawing commands such as drawing triangles, lines, rectangles, 2D images and so on. But I'm also wanting to expand it for 3D games in the near future. So complecated parts and simple parts are mixed together in this project.  

Current development environment:
    - macOS 10.13
    - Mac Pro (Late 2013) and MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)
